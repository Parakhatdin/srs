## 1. Introduction

The intro lays out a summary of the document’s content. It is supposed to answer the following questions:

- Short description of the document’s contents;  
- The intended readers of this document;
- The idea of the software you are developing;
- Intended readers.

### 1.1 Purpose  

Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.

### 1.2 Intended Audience

Define who in your organization will have access to the SRS and how they should use it. This may include developers, testers, and project managers. It could also include stakeholders in other departments, including leadership teams, sales, and marketing. Defining this now will lead to less work in the future.

### 1.3 Intended Use

Define who in your organization will have access to the SRS and how they should use it. This may include developers, testers, and project managers. It could also include stakeholders in other departments, including leadership teams, sales, and marketing. Defining this now will lead to less work in the future.

---

How do you imagine an individual will use your product? What are the functions you are providing for this type of use? Describe all the possible ways a person can use your product in whatever user role he/she acts.

### 1.4 Scope

What are the benefits, objectives, and goals we intend to have for this product? This should relate to overall business goals, especially if teams outside of development will have access to the SRS.

---

This part will describe the scope of work you need to perform to bring your idea to life.

### 1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

It’s important to define the risks in the project. What could go wrong? How do me mitigate these risks? Who is in charge of these risk items?
For example, if the failure of a medical device would cause slight injury, that is one level of risk. Taking into account the occurrence level and the severity, we can come up with a strategy to mitigate this risk.

---

This one will lay out the definitions of the terms you are using in the document to ensure a complete understanding by the users.

## 2. Overall Description

Here is the part where you explain the app’s idea, where it came from and why it can be interesting for users.

### 2.1 User Needs

Describe who will use the product and how. Understanding the user of the product and their needs is a critical part of the process.

Who will be using the product? Are they a primary or secondary user? Do you need to know about the purchaser of the product as well as the end user? In medical devices, you will also need to know the needs of the patient.

---

A piece of software that is built for everyone serves no one. But if you know exactly who your target audience is, where they work, and their pains, you'll have higher chances of delivering an app that's widely adopted by the users.

### 2.1 Assumptions and Dependencies

What are we assuming will be true? Understating and laying out these assumptions ahead of time will help with headaches later. Are we assuming current technology? Are we basing this on a Windows framework?  We need to take stock of these assumptions to better understand when our product would fail or not operate perfectly.

Finally, you should note if your project is dependent on any external factors. Are we reusing a bit of software from a previous project? This new project would then depend on that operating correctly and should be included.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

Now it is time to outline the technical requirements of your future software. Describe the features that your product will include, along with the standards that define the quality of these products.

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are essential to your product because, as they state, they provide some sort of functionality.

Asking yourself the question “does this add to my tool’s functionality?” Or “What function does this provide?” can help with this process. Within Medical devices especially, these functional requirements may have a subset of risks and requirements.

You may also have requirements that outline how your software will interact with other tools, which brings us to external interface requirements.

---

Functional requirements are system specifications, without which the software will not function properly. The definition you will give to your software features will determine how they will be further implemented.

### 3.2 External Interface Requirements

External interface requirements are specific types of functional requirements. These are especially important when working with embedded systems. They outline how your product will interface with other components.

There are several types of interfaces you may have requirements for, including:

- User
- Hardware
- Software
- Communications

### 3.3 System Features

System features are types of functional requirements. These are features that are required in order for a system to function.

### 3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements

Nonfunctional requirements can be just as important as functional ones.

These include:

- Performance
- Safety
- Security
- Quality

The importance of this type of requirement may vary depending on your industry. In the medical device industry, there are often regulations that require the tracking and accounting of safety.

---

Whereas functional requirements define what the system's function will be, non-functional requirements determine how the system will implement these features, for example, the speed of completion.
